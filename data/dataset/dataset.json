Constructed in 1889 as the entrance arch for the World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design. The tower stands 324 meters (1,063 ft) tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. Today, it is the most-visited paid monument in the world, attracting millions of visitors annually."

      "text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global weather patterns and average temperatures. Human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels, have led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere. This has resulted in global warming, rising sea levels, more frequent extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems. Addressing climate change requires international cooperation, reduction of carbon emissions, and transition to sustainable energy sources. The impacts of climate change are far-reaching, affecting agriculture, water resources, human health, and biodiversity worldwide."
